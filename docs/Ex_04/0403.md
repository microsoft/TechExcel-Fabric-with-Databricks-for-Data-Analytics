# Task 03: Read from the Silver layer, create a data model (Facts, Dimensions) on the data lake from Azure Databricks, and write data into Gold layer as external tables. (Z-ordered within ADLS Gen2 as the Gold layer)

The last step is to develop and implement a robust data model from the Silver layer, moving critical data into the Gold layer, thus bolstering Contoso's analytics and decision-making capabilities with structured and refined data sets. 

1. Switch back to the **Databricks** browser tab.

1. On the **Databricks** page, in the left navigation pane, select **Workspace**.

1. In the Users workspace, select the **Silver to Gold** notebook.

1. In the first code cell, populate the **ENTERHERE** placeholders with the following information.

    | Name | Value |Comment|
    |:---------|:---------|:---------|
    | scope   | **scopesecret**   ||
    | key   | **appServiceRegistrationSecret**   |You can also retrieve the secret from the Keys page for the key vault | 
    | storage_account |  **[Your Storage Account Name]**   |You can also retrieve the Storage Account name from the Storage Account resource page  |
    | application_id | **[Your Application ID]** | You can also retrieve this ID from the Microsoft Entra > App registration Overview page   |
    | directory_id | **[Your Directory (Tenant) ID]**  | You can also retrieve this ID from the Microsoft Entra > App registration Overview page    |


1. In the second code cell, replace the **ENTERHERE** placeholder with **medallion**.
    

1. In the sixth code cell, replace the **&lt;ENTERHERE&gt;** placeholder with the following code: 

    ```
	"select dp.ProductIDKey, ds.CustomerIDKey, soh.*, sod.OrderQty, sod.ProductID, sod.UnitPrice, sod.UnitPriceDiscount, sod.LineTotal from salesorderheader soh join salesorderdetail sod on soh.SalesOrderID = sod.SalesOrderID LEFT JOIN dimProduct dp ON sod.ProductID = dp.ProductID LEFT JOIN dimCustomer ds ON soh.CustomerID = ds.CustomerID"
    ```

1. In the thirteenth code cell, populate the **ENTERHERE** placeholder to create the df_factSales dataframe:

    ```
    select dp.ProductIDKey, ds.CustomerIDKey, soh.*, sod.OrderQty, sod.ProductID, sod.UnitPrice, sod.UnitPriceDiscount, sod.LineTotal from salesorderheader soh join salesorderdetail sod on soh.SalesOrderID = sod.SalesOrderID LEFT JOIN dimProduct dp ON sod.ProductID = dp.ProductID LEFT JOIN dimCustomer ds ON soh.CustomerID = ds.CustomerID
    ```

1. Select **Run all**.

1. Review the output for each cell.
