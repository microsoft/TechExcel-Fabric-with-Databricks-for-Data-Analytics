# Exercise 1: Create a Fabric workspace and data pipeline

Creating a Fabric workspace and data pipeline is the foundational step for consolidating Contoso's and Litware Inc.'s data, enabling unified data management and streamlined analytics within the Azure ecosystem. This infrastructure lays the groundwork for efficient data ingestion, storage, and processing. It helps the organization's address data silos and fosters a cohesive data environment.

In this exercise, you will continue preparinge the lab environment by performing the following tasks: 

- Create a Microsoft Fabric-enabled workspace: You will set up a workspace that uses Microsoft Fabric, enabling integration and management of data across various sources and platforms. 

- Create data lakes: You will configure Azure Data Lake Storage instances as central repositories for big data storage and analytics, facilitating scalable data storage solutions. 

- Using data pipelines/data flow for data ingestion: You will implement data pipelines and flows to efficiently ingest data into the system, ensuring a seamless flow of information for processing and analysis.  



Contoso is setting up a Fabric-enabled workspace as the cornerstone for Contoso's data integration efforts, facilitating a seamless blend of disparate data sources.
