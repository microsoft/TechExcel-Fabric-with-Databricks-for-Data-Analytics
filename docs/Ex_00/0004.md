# Task 0.4: Add a Lakehouse container to the Storage account.


As part of the pre-deployment steps for this lab environment, a storage account named storage@lab.LabInstance.Id. The account will serve as an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) storage account to provide a scalable, secure, and cost-effective storage for big data analytics workloads. 

Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) storage accounts combine the capabilities of Azure Blob Storage with the hierarchical namespace feature of Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 to offer enhanced performance, security, and analytics capabilities.

In this task, you will add a role assignment to the storage account. You will then add a container named medallion and subfolders to contain the bronze, silver, and gold medallion data.
