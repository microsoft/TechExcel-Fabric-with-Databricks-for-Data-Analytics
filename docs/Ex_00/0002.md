# Task 02: Create and add a client secret to an Azure Key Vault instance

Azure Key Vault is used to securely store and manage sensitive information such as passwords, encryption keys, and certificates. Key Vault provides a centralized and highly secure storage solution, safeguarding these critical assets from unauthorized access.  

By using Azure Key Vault, organizations can enhance security practices by reducing the risk of exposing sensitive data within applications or configuration files. Key Vault integrates seamlessly with other Azure services, enabling easy access to stored secrets while enforcing robust access control policies and auditing capabilities for compliance purposes. 

In this task, youâ€™ll provision an Azure Key Vault instance.
