# Exercise 3: Establish connectivity between Azure Databricks and Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen 2

By ensuring seamless data flow between Databricks and ADLS Gen 2, Contoso aims to accelerate their analytics and machine learning projects, unlocking new possibilities for innovation and efficiency. 

To achieve this, weâ€™ll take the following steps: 

- Deploy Databricks workspace: Set up a new Azure Databricks workspace to serve as the central hub for data analytics and processing. 

- Authenticate Azure Databricks to the storage account using a service principal: Securely connect your Databricks workspace to the ADLS Gen 2 storage account, employing a service principal for authentication to maintain security and manageability. 

- Connect to the data lake: Finalize the integration by connecting Azure Databricks directly to ADLS Gen 2, enabling direct access to stored data for advanced analytics and processing.
