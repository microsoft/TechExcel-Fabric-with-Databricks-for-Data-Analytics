# Exercise 2: Create a Fabric workspace and data pipeline

The creation of a Fabric workspace and data pipeline is the foundational step in consolidating Contoso's and Litware Inc.'s data, enabling unified data management and streamlined analytics within the Azure ecosystem. This infrastructure lays the groundwork for efficient data ingestion, storage, and processing, addressing data silos and fostering a cohesive data environment for Contoso.

In this exercise, youâ€™ll prepare the lab environment by performing the following tasks: 

- Create a Microsoft Fabric-enabled workspace: Set up a workspace that utilizes Microsoft Fabric, enabling the integration and management of data across various sources and platforms. 

- Create data lakes: Establish Azure Data Lake Storage instances, configuring them as central repositories for big data storage and analytics, facilitating scalable data storage solutions. 

- Using data pipelines/data flow for data ingestion: Implement data pipelines and flows to efficiently ingest data into the system, ensuring a seamless flow of information for processing and analysis.
